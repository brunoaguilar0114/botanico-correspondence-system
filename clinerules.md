# Project Rules

## Initial Understanding

Before making any modifications:

1. Analyze the complete project structure
2. Identify the technology stack used
3. Understand established code conventions
4. Review main dependencies and configurations

## Technology Stack

[Describe your stack here: WordPress, React, etc.]

## Key Structure

- /src - Main source code
- /assets - Static resources
  [etc.]

## Code Conventions

- Use Spanish for comments
- Follow camelCase naming
- [Your specific rules]

## When Making Changes

- Maintain existing architecture
- Document important changes
- Respect established patterns

# Complete Project Structure Analysis

I need you to thoroughly analyze the complete structure of this project to understand its architecture, organization, and functionality before making any modifications.

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Complete mapping of directory and file structure**
2. **Identification of architecture patterns and conventions**
3. **Understanding of dependencies and component relationships**
4. **Documentation of configurations and workflows**

## Required Analysis

### 1. Directory Structure

- List all main directories and their purpose
- Identify folder organization (src, public, assets, components, etc.)
- Document any special folders (config, utils, helpers, etc.)

### 2. Configuration Files

- Identify and analyze all configuration files (package.json, webpack, vite, tsconfig, etc.)
- List main dependencies and devDependencies
- Review available scripts in package.json
- Document environment variables if they exist (.env files)

### 3. Code Architecture

- Identify main framework/library (React, Vue, WordPress, etc.)
- Analyze component/module structure
- Document design patterns used
- Identify routing or navigation system
- Review state management (Redux, Context API, Vuex, etc.)

### 4. Styles and Assets

- Identify styling system (CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, CSS Modules, etc.)
- Document style file organization
- List static assets (images, fonts, icons)
- Review theme system or CSS variables

### 5. Backend and APIs (if applicable)

- Identify API endpoints
- Document services and controllers
- Review data models
- Analyze middleware and authentication

### 6. Database (if applicable)

- Identify database type
- Review schemas and models
- Document migrations if they exist

### 7. Integrations and Plugins

- List installed plugins or extensions
- Document external service integrations
- Identify third-party APIs used

## Expected Response Format

Provide a structured document with:

1. **Executive Summary**: General project description in 3-5 lines
2. **Technology Stack**: List of main technologies
3. **Directory Tree**: Visual structure with explanations
4. **Key Components**: List of main files/modules with their function
5. **Data Flows**: How data moves through the application
6. **Important Configurations**: Critical settings to consider
7. **Code Conventions**: Patterns detected in the project
8. **Entry Points**: Main files where execution begins
9. **Build and Deploy**: Compilation and deployment process

## Immediate Action

Please begin analysis by exploring:

1. Root file (package.json, composer.json, or equivalent)
2. Main folder structure
3. Entry files (index.html, main.js, index.php, etc.)

Once this analysis is complete, I'll be ready to request specific changes with full project context.
